## Introduction :dart:

Artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting topics in computer science today. The following workshop session aims to give you a general understanding of how genetic algorithm works, its benefits and limitations, and how to implement it in your own A.I. projects.
Workshop to discover Neural Network through the subject of identify the genre of a music

## Requirements :books:

- Python 3.8 -> Install python 3.8 [here](https://www.w3computing.com/python/installing-python-windows-macos-linux/)

## Workshop Content :bulb:

The workshop is divided into 3 parts:

- **Part 1**: Introduction to neural networks and the basics of the machine learning
- **Part 2**: Developing a neural network
- **Part 3**: Testing and upgrading the neural network

**You will find the content of all these parts in the pdf [here](TODO)**
